# Chromosome-identifier
neural network model using yolov8 to identify chromosomes
Chromosome identification is a cornerstone of genetic research and clinical diagnostics. Accurate detection and classification of chromosomes are essential for diagnosing genetic disorders, guiding prenatal care, and other fields. Traditional manual methods for chromosomal analysis, while reliable, are labor-intensive and time-consuming, making them less practical in high-demand medical environments.

The development of a neural network for chromosome identification offers a promising solution to these challenges. By automating the detection and classification process, neural networks can significantly enhance the efficiency of chromosomal analysis
The model was trained using Colab, the paths in the notebooks are relative but if it is executed in local some extra configs are needed
